# AI Interview Assistant - Critical Issues Fixed

## üêõ **Issues Identified & Fixed:**

### 1. **Double Submission Bug** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Answers were being submitted twice in the chat
**Root Cause**: Multiple event handlers triggering without proper state management
**Solution**: 
- Added `isSubmitting` state to prevent concurrent submissions
- Updated `handleSendMessage` and `handleAnswerSubmit` with proper guards
- Fixed event handler logic to prevent double triggers

### 2. **Resume Parsing Failure** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: PDF text extraction not working properly
**Root Cause**: Inadequate error handling and fallback mechanisms
**Solution**:
- Improved PDF parsing with better error handling using pdf-parse
- Enhanced extractFields.ts with regex fallbacks when AI fails
- Added text length validation and meaningful error messages
- Better file type validation (PDF only for now)

### 3. **Incorrect/Random Scoring** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Wrong answers getting 75+ marks, questions showing as undefined

- Implemented intelligent fallback scoring based on:
  - Answer length and complexity
  - Presence of code examples
  - Technical keywords
  - Question difficulty level
- Fixed scoreAnswer function to return proper structured responses

### 4. **Dashboard Data Sync Issues** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Interview data not syncing between tabs
**Root Cause**: No real-time data updates and missing API integration
